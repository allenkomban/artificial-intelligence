The goal is to take out-of-the-box models and apply them to a given dataset. The task is to analyse the data and build a model to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data (also known as "Census Income" dataset).
Use the data set Adult Data Set from the Machine Learning repository [2].
Use the supervised learning methods discussed in the lectures, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
Do not code these methods: instead use the implementations from scikit-learn. Read the scikit-learn documentation on Decision Trees [3] and Naive Bayes [4], and the linked pages describing the parameters of the methods.
This question will help you master the workflow of model building. For example, you’ll get to practice how to use the critical steps:
• Importing data
• Cleaning data
• Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets
• Pre-processing
• Transformations
• Feature engineering
Use the sklearn documentation pages for instructions. You should need the classification algorithms.
There are also available Tutorials:
• Sklearn – official tutorial for the sklearn package
• Predicting wine quality with scikit-learn – Step-by-step tutorial for training a
machine learning model
